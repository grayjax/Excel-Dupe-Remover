# Excel-Dupe-Remover
Quickly removes duplicate entries in an excel file

Plenty of ways within excel to delete duplicates but this allows for quicker pruning when dealing with larger data sets. 

It will keep one duplicate entry and remove the others. Replace the input_csv_path with your file you want to clean up and the output_csv_path with your desired output.
